# A strategy for fighting the "FAANG" tech giants

Even while it turbocharges movements to fight unaccountable power, the Internet itself is becoming one. The tech press has a fun name for the companies driving this trend: [FAANG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech#FAANG) (Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, and Google.)  

To accompany the [HOPE](https://hope.net/) talk [Zbay, Fighting FAANG, and the Quest for a Peer-To-Peer Messaging App That "Just Works"](https://scheduler.hope.net/hope2020/talk/FWAUQM/), this page proposes a strategy for fighting FAANG: building free software, peer-to-peer apps that, like predecessors [Limewire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LimeWire) and Bitcoin, are *fully forkable*, that is, forkable in ways that preserve the full content and user experience of the original.

## Peer-to-peer mesaging apps

Messaging seems like a uniquely promising place where peer-to-peer apps can fight FAANG, so the talk (and this page) focus on messaging apps. This list is not comprehensive, and if there is an approach to peer-to-peer messaging you'd like to see listed here, [submit a pull request](https://github.com/ZbayApp/fightfaang) or [contact us](mailto:h@zbay.llc).
